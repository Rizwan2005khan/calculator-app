# Calculator Project

## Description
This project is a web-based calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator is fully responsive, includes a custom logo, and provides error handling for invalid operations. It was created as a practice project to enhance my understanding of JavaScript and DOM manipulation.

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox and Media Queries for responsiveness)
